  abstract={In this paper, we survey recent progress on the variational theory related to the area functional and the mean curvature. 
            We mainly discuss the Morse theory of minimal hypersurfaces. 
            In particular, we focus on the variational theory for constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces, the multiplicity one conjecture, generic spatial distributions of minimal hypersurfaces, the variational theory for minimal surfaces with free boundary, 
            and generalizations in the equivariant settings.},
