  abstract={In this paper, we consider a closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with dimension $3\leq n+1\leq 7$, and a compact Lie group G acting as isometries on M with cohomogeneity at least $3$. 
            After adapting the Almgren–Pitts min–max theory to a $G$-equivariant version, we show the existence of a non-trivial closed smooth embedded $G$-invariant minimal hypersurface $\Sigma \subset M$ provided that the union of non-principal orbits forms a smooth embedded submanifold of M with dimension at most $n-2$. 
            Moreover, we also build upper bounds as well as lower bounds of $(G, p)$-widths, which are analogs of the classical conclusions derived by Gromov and Guth. 
            An application of our results combined with the work of Marques–Neves shows the existence of infinitely many G-invariant minimal hypersurfaces when $Ric_M>0$ and orbits satisfy the same assumption above.

  title={Min-max theory for free boundary G-invariant minimal hypersurfaces},
  author={Wang, Tongrui},
  journal={Advances in Mathematics},

  year={2023},
  publisher={Elsevier},
  abstract={Given a compact Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with dimension $3\leq n+1\leq 7$ and $\partial M\neq\emptyset$, the free boundary min-max theory built by Li-Zhou shows the existence of a smooth almost properly embedded minimal hypersurface with free boundary in $M$. 
            In this paper, we generalize their constructions into equivariant settings. 
            Specifically, let $G$ be a compact Lie group acting as isometries on $M$ with cohomogeneity at least $3$. 
            Then there exists a nontrivial smooth almost properly embedded free boundary $G$-invariant minimal hypersurface. 
            Moreover, if the Ricci curvature of $M$ is non-negative and $\partial M$ is strictly convex, then there exist infinitely many properly embedded $G$-invariant minimal hypersurfaces with free boundary. },

  title={Equivariant Morse index of min-max $ G $-invariant minimal hypersurfaces},
  author={Wang, Tongrui},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.07638},
  year={2022},
  abstract={For a closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with a compact Lie group $G$ acting as isometries, we generalize the Morse index estimates for min-max minimal hypersurfaces to the equivariant setting provided $3\leq {\rm codim}(G\cdot p) \leq 7$ for all $p\in M$. 
            Namely, the closed $G$-invariant minimal hypersurface $\Sigma\subset M$ constructed by the equivariant min-max on a $k$-dimensional homotopy class can be chosen to satisfy ${\rm Index}_G(\Sigma)\leq k$. 
            Moreover, we also show a compactness theorem for min-max minimal $G$-hypersurfaces and construct a $G$-invariant Jacobi field on the limit, which further implies a $C^\infty_G$-generic finiteness result for min-max $G$-hypersurfaces with area uniformly bounded. },
