  abstract={In this paper, we consider a closed Riemannian manifold $$M^{n+1}$$with dimension $$3\le n+1\le 7$$, and a compact Lie group G acting as isometries on M with cohomogeneity at least 3. After adapting the Almgren–Pitts min–max theory to a G-equivariant version, we show the existence of a non-trivial closed smooth embedded G-invariant minimal hypersurface $$\Sigma \subset M$$provided that the union of non-principal orbits forms a smooth embedded submanifold of M with dimension at most $$n-2$$. Moreover, we also build upper bounds as well as lower bounds of (G, p)-widths, which are analogs of the classical conclusions derived by Gromov and Guth. An application of our results combined with the work of Marques–Neves shows the existence of infinitely many G-invariant minimal hypersurfaces when $$\mathrm{Ric}_M>0$$and orbits satisfy the same assumption above.}
