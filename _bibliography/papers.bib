  abstract={In this paper, we consider a closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with dimension $3\leq n+1\leq 7$, and a compact Lie group G acting as isometries on M with cohomogeneity at least $3$. 
            After adapting the Almgren–Pitts min–max theory to a $G$-equivariant version, we show the existence of a non-trivial closed smooth embedded $G$-invariant minimal hypersurface $\Sigma \subset M$ provided that the union of non-principal orbits forms a smooth embedded submanifold of M with dimension at most $n-2$. 
            Moreover, we also build upper bounds as well as lower bounds of $(G, p)$-widths, which are analogs of the classical conclusions derived by Gromov and Guth. 
            An application of our results combined with the work of Marques–Neves shows the existence of infinitely many G-invariant minimal hypersurfaces when $Ric_M>0$ and orbits satisfy the same assumption above.

  title={Min-max theory for free boundary G-invariant minimal hypersurfaces},

  year={2023},
  publisher={Elsevier},
  abstract={Given a compact Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with dimension $3\leq n+1\leq 7$ and $\partial M\neq\emptyset$, the free boundary min-max theory built by Li-Zhou shows the existence of a smooth almost properly embedded minimal hypersurface with free boundary in $M$. 
            In this paper, we generalize their constructions into equivariant settings. 
            Specifically, let $G$ be a compact Lie group acting as isometries on $M$ with cohomogeneity at least $3$. 
            Then there exists a nontrivial smooth almost properly embedded free boundary $G$-invariant minimal hypersurface. 
            Moreover, if the Ricci curvature of $M$ is non-negative and $\partial M$ is strictly convex, then there exist infinitely many properly embedded $G$-invariant minimal hypersurfaces with free boundary. },

  title={Equivariant Morse index of min-max $ G $-invariant minimal hypersurfaces},

  arXiv={2210.07638},
  year={2023},
  abstract={For a closed Riemannian manifold $$M^{n+1}$$ with a compact Lie group G acting as isometries, the equivariant min–max theory gives the existence and the potential abundance of minimal G-invariant hypersurfaces provided $$3\le \textrm{codim}(G\cdot p) \le 7$$ for all $$p\in M$$. 
 	In this paper, we show a compactness theorem for these min–max minimal G-hypersurfaces and construct a G-invariant Jacobi field on the limit. 
	Combining with an equivariant bumpy metrics theorem, we obtain a $$C^\infty _G$$-generic finiteness result for min–max G-hypersurfaces with area uniformly bounded. 
	As a main application, we further generalize the Morse index estimates for min–max minimal hypersurfaces to the equivariant setting. 
	Namely, the closed G-invariant minimal hypersurface $$\Sigma \subset M$$ constructed by the equivariant min–max on a k-dimensional homotopy class can be chosen to satisfy $$\textrm{Index}_G(\Sigma )\le k$$.},

  title={Equivariant min-max hypersurface in $ G $-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature},
  author={Wang, Tongrui},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.03656},
  year={2023},
  abstract={In this paper, we consider a connected orientable closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with positive Ricci curvature. 
	Suppose $$G$$ is a compact Lie group acting by isometries on $$M$$ with $$3\leq codim(G\cdot p)\leq 7$$ for all $$p\in M$$. 
	Then we show the equivariant min-max $$G$$-hypersurface $$\Sigma$$ corresponding to the fundamental class $$[M]$$ is a multiplicity one minimal $$G$$-hypersurface with a $$G$$-invariant unit normal and $$G$$-equivariant index one. 
	As an application, we are able to establish a genus bound for $$\Sigma$$, a control on the singular points of $$\Sigma/G$$, and an upper bound for the (first) $$G$$-width of $$M$$ provided $$n+1=3$$ and the actions of $$G$$ are orientation preserving. },
