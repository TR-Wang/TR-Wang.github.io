  year={2023},
  abstract={In this paper, we consider a connected orientable closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with positive Ricci curvature. 
	Suppose $$G$$ is a compact Lie group acting by isometries on $$M$$ with $$3\leq codim(G\cdot p)\leq 7$$ for all $$p\in M$$. 
	Then we show the equivariant min-max $$G$$-hypersurface $$\Sigma$$ corresponding to the fundamental class $$[M]$$ is a multiplicity one minimal $$G$$-hypersurface with a $$G$$-invariant unit normal and $$G$$-equivariant index one. 
	As an application, we are able to establish a genus bound for $$\Sigma$$, a control on the singular points of $$\Sigma/G$$, and an upper bound for the (first) $$G$$-width of $$M$$ provided $$n+1=3$$ and the actions of $$G$$ are orientation preserving. },

  title={Curvature estimates for stable free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in locally wedge-shaped manifolds}, 
  author={Liam Mazurowski and Tongrui Wang},

  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.12948},
  primaryClass={math.DG},
  abstract={In this paper, we consider locally wedge-shaped manifolds, which are Riemannian manifolds that are allowed to have both boundary and certain types of edges. 
    We define and study the properties of free boundary minimal hypersurfaces inside locally wedge-shaped manifolds. 
    In particular, we show a compactness theorem for free boundary minimal hypersurfaces with curvature and area bounds in a locally wedge-shaped manifold. 
    Additionally, using Schoen-Simon-Yauâ€™s estimates, we also prove a Bernstein-type theorem indicating that, under certain conditions, a stable free boundary minimal hypersurface inside a Euclidean wedge must be a portion of a hyperplane. 
    As our main application, we establish a curvature estimate for sufficiently regular free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in a locally wedge-shaped manifold. 
    We expect this curvature estimate will be useful for establishing a min-max theory for the area functional in wedge-shaped spaces.},

  abstract={We develop a min-max theory for the area functional in the class of locally wedge-shaped manifolds. Roughly speaking, a locally wedge-shaped manifold is a Riemannian manifold that is allowed to have both boundary and certain types of edges. 
        Fix a dimension $3 \le n+1 \le 6$. 
        As our main theorem, we prove that every compact locally wedge-shaped manifold $M^{n+1}$ with acute wedge angles contains a locally wedge-shaped free boundary minimal hypersurface $\Sigma^n$ which is smooth in its interior and on its faces and is $C^{2,\alpha}$ up to and including its edge. 
        We can also handle the case of 90 degree wedge angles under an additional assumption.},
